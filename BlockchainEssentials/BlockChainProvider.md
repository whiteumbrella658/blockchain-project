# Top Three Blockchain Ecosystem Segments

The report divides the blockchain vendor ecosystem into three categories.
1. Applications and solutions providers include bitcoin wallet operators and payment providers.
2. Middleware and services include software platforms that allow enterprises to build blockchain applications. Such companies include Factom, BlockCypher, Colu and Chain Inc.
3. Infrastructure and protocols players seek to use blockchain technology to create cryptographically-secure, distributed consensus mechanisms. Examples include Ethereum, an open source, crowdfunded project that has become a bitcoin blockchain alternative. Ripple has also developed its own distributed ledger technology. The infrastructure and protocols segment has secured just under $300 million in venture funding, two-thirds of which occurred in 2015.
