# Using Bitcoin is as easy as Email!
|Email  |Bitcoin   |
|---|---|
|1. Open an email account and get an email address   | Open a Bitcoin Wallet and get a Bitcoin address  |
|2. Access your email account to see all the emails you’ve sent and received  | Access your Bitcoin wallet to see all the bitcoins you’ve sent and received (known as Bitcoin transactions)  |
|3. Receive an email from a friend by sharing your email address   |Receive bitcoins from a friend by sharing your bitcoin address (this is one way to get bitcoins)   |
|4. Send an email virtually for free to a friend by entering their email address   |Send bitcoins virtually free to a friend by entering their Bitcoin address   |

To show how these 4 parts work together, let’s pretend that Aisha wants to send 1 Bitcoin (“BTC”) to Bashir.** Here’s what happens:
1. **Aisha asks the Miners the send 1 BTC from her Bitcoin address (“1AcL2…”) to Bashir’s Bitcoin address (“1Bq34…”). This “request” is actually a Bitcoin transaction.

2. **The Miners audit her transaction.** They check that the transaction is valid and verify that Aisha is allowed to move the money. They do this second part by checking the Block Chain to confirm that she has enough bitcoin at her address to make the payment and that she isn’t also trying to send the same bitcoin to someone else at same time (i.e. “double-spending”)

3. **Once the transaction is approved and the Block Chain is updated, Bashir has the bitcoin.** He doesn’t need to take any action to receive it, but if he were to check the Block Chain now he would see an extra bitcoin at his address.


What is the Block Chain?
The Block Chain is a public record (or “ledger”) of how much bitcoin belongs to each and every bitcoin address. Basically, it keeps track of where all the bitcoins are.


What are addresses?
A Bitcoin address, like a bank account number, is where your bitcoins are stored. It is also what you share publicly with people to receive money. It is represented by a series of numbers and letters: 1Lqx7VV1u4q9QRY2f64Bd17ZVc8XZCHZbT

What are miners?
Miners are the “auditors” or “referees” of the Block Chain – they make sure all Bitcoin transactions are valid and that no one is tampering with the Block Chain. Specifically miners are Bitcoin users who have chosen to run special software which does the auditing automatically – in return for their efforts Miners are given bitcoin.



What are transactions?
A Bitcoin transaction is like any other financial transaction (like credit card purchases or Paypal money transfers): it records the movement of funds from one account to another. Specifically a Bitcoin transaction updates the Block Chain to record the movement of bitcoin from one bitcoin address to another.
