# Blockchain essentials

* [IBM Think Academy: Blockchain, How it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9KAnkZUjU)


# understand
* learn common challenges facing business networks and how a new approach to recording and processing transactions that uses blockchain technology
* Blockchain and distributed ledger systems in a business environment
* Important concepts and key use cases of blockchain for business
* How assets can be transferred in a blockchain network


# What is blockchain
* Business networks are often inefficient because 
  * each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. 
  * This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.

* One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.


# Business Network
![1](https://media.licdn.com/media-proxy/ext?w=800&h=800&hash=yoDynyOEckjDbfhKhMehDV%2FZaVo%3D&ora=1%2CaFBCTXdkRmpGL2lvQUFBPQ%2CxAVta9Er0Vinkhwfjw8177yE41y87UNCVordEGXyD3u0qYrdfya4fs7dfOGkuVwQcSQclABnLfKgSWbkD5W1KN7rft112ZXjI424ZxUBbFImi24)
* [An Example Business Network -- Car Auction Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgSKkrlLugQ)


* Business Network
  * Participants are customers, suppliers, banks, partners
  * Cross geography & gegulatory boundary
* Wealth 
  * Geneated by the folw of goods & services accorss business network in transcations and contracts
* Markets
  * Public (Fruit market, car auction)
  * Private (Supply chain finanacing, bonds)


# Transferring assets, building value 
* Anything that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value is asert

* Two funtamental types of asset
  * Tangible, e.g. a house
  * Intangible, e.g. a mortgage
    * Intangible assets subdivide
      * Finacial ex: bond
      * Intellectual, ex: patents
      * Digital, Ex: Music

* Cash is also an asset
  * Has property of anonymity
  
# Ledgers
* **Ledger** is it is system of record for a business. Business will have multiple ledgers for multiple business network in which they participate.
* **Transcation** - An assert trasnfer onto or off the ledger
  * John gives a car to Mike
* **Contract** conditipons for transcation to occur
  * If Mike pays John money, then car passes from John to Mike
  * if car won't start, function do not pass to John

Hash function
	One way function
	Any degital data (bit, text, number, image, file, font)
	COmpletely diffrent if you add a bit
	No ways to geenrate input based on output

	Quetion, hasing vs encrpete

Merkel works
	Data Stucture

Bloch Chain
	All BC will have some kind of root
	When the transcation happened, it will be added to root and create new root

Shared Ledger
* Records all the transcations accross business network
* shared between participants
* Participants have own copy through replication
* Permissioned, so participants see only appropirate transcations
* The shared system of record


Smart Contracts
Business rules implied by the contract, embedded in the Blokchain and executed with the transcation
Verifie, signed
Encoded in programming language
Example: Defineds contracual conditions under which corporate bond transfer occures

Privacy
* The ledger is shared but participants require privacy
* Participants needs
  * Appropriate confidentality between subsets of participants
  * idendity not linked to a transcation
* Transcations needs to be authenticated
* Cryptography central to these processes

Trust
* THe ledger is a trusted source of information
* participants endorse transcations
  * Business network decides who will endorder transcations
  * Endorsed trascation are added to the ledger with appropriate confidentiality
* Asserts have a verifiable audit trails
  * Trancations cannot be modified, inserted or deleted
* Achieved through consensus, provenance, immutability and finality

Transfer assets in a business blockchain
Transferring assets is the heart of blockchain. How can people buy and sell or transfer goods in a business network without any central governing body or policy?
The following video demonstrates exactly that: how an asset, such as a car, can be transferred (bought or sold) to other people. That process is compared to the traditional way assets (goods or services) are transferred between different people.
